<h2>Router-outlet</h2>
<hr>

<p>
  The <bold>router-outlet</bold> directive in Angular acts as a placeholder where the router should display the component for the current route. It's like a dynamic component loader controlled by the router.

    When you navigate between routes, Angular removes the previous component and inserts the new component in place of the <bold>router-outlet</bold>. This allows you to switch between different parts of your application without a full page reload.
    
    Here's a simple example:
    
    Let's say you have two routes: /home and /about.
    Both routes are tied to two separate components: HomeComponent and AboutComponent.
    When a user navigates to /home, the HomeComponent will be loaded and displayed where the <bold>router-outlet</bold> is located in your main app template.
    When the user navigates to /about, the HomeComponent will be removed, and the AboutComponent will be loaded and displayed in the same spot.
</p>

<router-outlet></router-outlet>
